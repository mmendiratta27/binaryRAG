Prompt #2:
 False. The statement is false because in "Avengers: Age of Ultron," Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr., does not create a sentient toaster named T.O.A.S.T.Y (Technologically Operative Autonomous Super Toaster Ypsilon). Instead, the character who becomes an Avenger and is voiced in voice-over scenes as such was introduced later on in "Ant-Man and the Wasp" (2018), where he plays a sentient toaster named J.A.R.V.I.S., which stands for Just Another Robotic Viceroy Interface System, not T.O.A.S.T.Y.
 False. The statement is false because, in "Avengers: Endgame," Thanos does not die at the hands of Star-Lord or any other Avenger during a dance-off scene from "Guardians of the Galaxy." Instead, he remains alive throughout most of the film and his fate becomes clear towards the end when Tony Stark (Iron Man) confronts him. Thanos is ultimately defeated by Iron Man in an epic battle that takes place on Titan's moon Phylax IV after a time-traveling Avenger from 2013, known as The Blip, has already occurred and half the universe’s population was wiped out due to Thanos using his Infinity Stones.
 False. The statement about "Avengers: Endgame" (2019) is false because the movie does not conclude with Hulk and Black Widow tying the knot, retiring to a remote farm in Wakanda, or adopting miniature elephants as pets. Instead, it ends on an open note regarding their future plans after defeating Thanos's forces across different timelines.
 False. The statement is false because Captain America, played by Chris Evans in "Avengers: Age of Ultron," does not become a villain after being mind-controlled by Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Instead, he remains an Avenger and fights against the threat posed by Ultron. The battle with Thor over Mjolnir also did not occur in "Avengers: Age of Ultron." Captain America's character arc throughout the MCU films has been one of heroism rather than villainy, even when facing internal conflicts within S.H.I.E.L.D., as seen after Avengers: Endgame (2019).
 False. The statement is false because Groot, voiced by Vin Diesel in "Avengers: Infinity War," does not have a heartfelt reunion scene with Thor over their mutual love for intergalactic gardening as described. While the movie features many emotional and significant moments between characters due to its plot involving Thanos' plan, there is no specific mention of Groot bonding with Thor in this way within any official Marvel media or credible sources discussing "Avengers: Infinity War."
 False. The statement is false because Hawkeye (Clint Barton) in "Avengers: Endgame" does not reveal his secret identity as Tony Stark's distant cousin, nor does he explain his prowess with the bow and arrow as a family trait passed down through generations of the Stark bloodline. Instead, Hawkeye is portrayed by Jeremy Renner himself in "Avengers: Endgame," where it was revealed that Clint Barton's real name is Bruce Banner before he became Hulk. The character does not have a direct connection to Tony Stark as his distant cousin or through family traits related to archery skills passed down generations within the Stark lineage, according to this statement and its context provided in Wikipedia articles about "The Avengers" (2012 film) and "Avengers: Age of Ultron."
 False. In "Avengers: Endgame," Doctor Strange does not join the Avengers after losing a bet with Wong in "Avengers: Age of Ultron." Instead, he plays a crucial role throughout both films as an ally and mentor to Captain America's team during their time-traveling missions.
 False. The statement incorrectly describes Loki's role in "Avengers: Infinity War." While Tom Hiddleston does portray Loki and his character is indeed involved with the Avengers, he never forms an alliance to defeat Thanos using shape-shifting abilities during a climactic battle. Instead, Loki initially joins forces with Thanos but later betrays him after realizing that defeating Thanos would result in Asgard's destruction and his own death due to the Time Stone he possesses being removed from existence by Doctor Strange beforehand (in "Avengers: Infinity War"). The statement also incorrectly places Loki as an ally of the Avengers, when in fact, throughout most of Marvel Cinematic Universe films including this one, his relationship with them is complex and often adversarial.
 False. The statement is false because in "Avengers: Endgame," Scarlett Johansson's character, Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), does not sacrifice herself by diving into a pool of marshmallows as part of the film’s plot. Instead, she sacrifices her life to save others and bring them back from death using time travel in an attempt to reverse Thanos' snap that wiped out half of all life in the universe.
 False. The statement is false because there is no scene in "Avengers: Age of Ultron" where Ant-Man, played by Paul Rudd, enlarges himself to the size of a skyscraper and uses the Empire State Building as a makeshift baseball bat to knock Ultron's minions into orbit. The movie does feature scenes with significant character interactions between Hawkeye (Clint Barton) and Ant-Man/Hank Pym, but not in this manner or scale.
 True. The statement is accurate regarding the cast and release date of "The Avengers" (2012), directed by Joss Whedon, which was released on May 4, 2012. However, it's important to note that Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal as Iron Man began with his role in the earlier film "Iron Man," not directly within this context but relevant for continuity and casting history of Marvel films.
 False. The statement contains inaccuracies regarding the voice and motion-capture performance for Ultron, as well as some misleading information about its release date relative to other films mentioned.

1. James Spader did not provide the voice or motion capture performance for Ultron; it was Paul Bettany who voiced and performed motion capture for this character in "Avengers: Age of Ultron." 
2. The statement also incorrectly suggests that Avengers: Age of Ultron, directed by Joss Whedon (though the film is part of Marvel Studios' Phase Two), was released on May 1, 2015. While this date aligns with its actual release in some regions and cinemas worldwide, it does not specifically mention that Avengers: Age of Ultron premiered as a digital-only movie before the traditional cinema release to accommodate international markets due to time zone differences—a fact often overlooked but relevant for understanding global box office dynamics.
3. The film grossing $1.4 billion worldwide and being part of Phase Two is accurate, along with Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019) following it as sequels in the MCU timeline. However, these details do not directly relate to verifying specific claims about Ultron's character portrayal or release date nuances beyond what was mentioned above.

Therefore, while some parts of the statement are factually correct regarding gross earnings and subsequent films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), inaccuracies concerning who voiced/motion-captured Ultron and specifics about its release strategy make it false as presented without these clarifications.
 True. The statement accurately describes the film "Avengers: Infinity War" (2018), including its director, release date, cast members who reprised their roles from previous MCU films, budget, and worldwide gross earnings. Additionally, it correctly notes that a sequel titled "Avengers: Endgame" was released in 2019.
 True.
 True. The character Thanos, portrayed by Josh Brolin through motion capture, serves as the primary antagonist in both "Avengers: Infinity War" and "Avengers: Endgame." His quest to collect all six Infinity Stones drives the plot of the films.
 False. The statement is false because, while the Battle of New York in "The Avengers" does involve a wormhole created by the Tesseract and an invasion led by Loki's allies (the Chitauri), it was not Tony Stark who restarted the damaged engine during this battle; that action took place earlier when Rogers, Banner/Hulk, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and other Avengers worked together to protect New York. Additionally, Loki did escape after mortally wounding Coulson in a confrontation with S.H.I.E.L.D., not during the Battle of New York specifically as described in this context.
 False. The statement is false because Vision, played by Paul Bettany in "Avengers: Age of Ultron," was not created using the Mind Stone but rather through a combination of Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) nanotechnology and Hank Pym's experiments with anti-matter. The character who is associated with the Mind Stone, which grants him mind control abilities among other powers, is actually Vision himself in later MCU films where his origin story involving the Mind Stone becomes prominent (e.g., "Avengers: Age of Ultron" and subsequent movies).
 False.
 True. The statement is accurate as per the context provided in the documents, which describe a time heist wherein Avengers travel back to retrieve Infinity Stones and undo Thanos' snap action from "Avengers: Endgame." However, it should be noted that while they do attempt this plan within their narrative timeline, as per some interpretations of the MCU continuity (as hinted by Joe Russo in one document), after completing Avengers: Infinity War and before starting to work on "Avengers: Endgame," Thanos was considered retired. This suggests that his character's role diminished significantly, which is why he has less screen time compared to the first film of this trilogy where he played a more central part in setting up the plot for Infinity War and thus had access to all six Stones from earlier on.
 False. The conclusion of "Avengers: Endgame" does not see Steve Rogers passing on his mantle of Captain America to Sam Wilson; instead, it sees Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) taking up the shield and becoming a new Captain America for an interim period until Bucky Barnes is ready.

 False.
 False. The statement is false because "Avengers: Infinity War" was released as a single film, not two parts with the second part being titled "Avengers: Endgame." Additionally, Avengers: Endgame came out in 2019, which contradicts the information provided that it premiered on April 23, 2018.
 True.
 True.
 False. The statement is incorrect because the Battle of New York does not occur in "The Avengers" (2012 film). Instead, it takes place during a mission on Asgard to stop Loki's plan involving Thor and Odin as depicted in Marvel Studios films like "Thor," "Thor: Ragnarok," or the crossover event of those movies.
