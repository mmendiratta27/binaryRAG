There are a few text files with different purposes which I have outlined below.

`statements.txt` contains all the statements being entered into the LLM with each statement separated by a newline character.

`prompts.txt` contains each prompt being entered into the LLM with each statement separated by a newline character.

`output.txt` stores all the LLM generations

`results.txt` contains the final accuracy and time results for each model and prompt (some numbers may be slightly inaccurate due to case sensitivity problem we discussed on call).
