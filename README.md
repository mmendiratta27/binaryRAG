This is a basic **Retreival Augmented Generation (RAG)** Pipeline, using Ollama (llama3), langchain, and a a sentence-transformers model. To use, change the question variable in the `rag.py` file and the web url/text for proper context. This is an example of the program output.

Question:  Explain prompt engineering to me.

Prompt engineering is the process of structuring words that can be interpreted and understood by a text-to-image model, allowing you to communicate with a generative AI model. It involves crafting instructions or prompts that can be followed by the AI, such as providing context, specifying styles, or assigning roles. This enables the AI to perform tasks like generating images or writing text based on the input prompt.
